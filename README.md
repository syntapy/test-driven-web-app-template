# Intro

A skeleton repo to set up a web app in Docker with automated tests using an automated browser of your choice (Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, etc...)

It runs the web app and the test client separate containers

You must provide the code for each

It also provides github actions workflow template as well

You will need to install Docker and Compose for this, and provide an installation script for each 

# Motivation

The idea is to make it easy to set up automated browser and screenshot tests for a new or existing project

The use of docker is to make screenshot tests reliable across different machines
